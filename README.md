This repository is the first time for me to know how to use python.

I had studied about the introduction of a tool called Python and the fundamental concepts that I needed to understand in order to use it further, including data types and structures.

Data types and structures in Python refer to the various ways data can be organized and represented in the programming language. Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floats, strings, and more. Data structures, on the other hand, are used to store and manipulate collections of data, like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective programming in Python.
